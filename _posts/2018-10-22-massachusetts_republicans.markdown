description:
  We argue that the underperformance of Republicans in Massachusetts is not
  attributable to gerrymandering, nor to the failure of Republicans to field
  House candidates, but is a structural mathematical feature of the distribution
  of votes. For several of the elections studied here, there are more ways of
  building a valid districting plan than there are particles in the galaxy, and
  every one of them will produce a 9-0 Democratic delegation.
